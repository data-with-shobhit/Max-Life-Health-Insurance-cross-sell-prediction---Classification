# Health Insurance Cross-Sell Prediction Project

## **Overview**
This repository includes the code and documentation for a data science project focused on predicting customer interest in cross-selling vehicle insurance within a health insurance company.

## **Project Highlights**

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - Effective handling of missing values, outliers, and categorical data encoding.
   - Strategic feature engineering to enhance model performance.

2. **Customer Segmentation and Analysis:**
   - Utilization of label encoder for customer segmentation.
   - Extraction of actionable insights from distinct customer segments.

3. **Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Analysis:**
   - Formulation and testing of hypotheses to uncover underlying patterns.
   - Application of statistical tests for robust decision-making.

4. **Data Visualization and Storytelling:**
   - Structured analysis including univariate, bivariate, and multivariate aspects following the "UBM" rule.
   - Clear communication of findings through effective visualizations.

5. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Implementation of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
   - Addressing data imbalance using SMOTE to enhance model performance.

6. **Model Evaluation and Selection:**
   - Evaluation metrics include precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and AUC-ROC.
   - Selection of XGBoost as the final model for its superior performance in classification tasks.


**Project Conclusion**
   - The project effectively addressed data challenges, implemented robust machine learning models, and provided actionable insights for strategic marketing decisions. Continued refinement and optimization of models will be essential for sustained success.
